a.) For programming experience I programmed in C# for a time in high school, creating retro videogames. I just started C last semester in 1310.

b.) I have always been pretty decent at math, as of right now, I am taking Calculus 2 for this semester.

c.) I want to learn to program because I am trying to find a job in the field, as it is a job that will always exist. I also enjoy programming and learning about it. Even though it might be hard, the satisfaction of making a code work is amazing.
